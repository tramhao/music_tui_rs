**Freedom**: As time goes by, online service providers control pretty much everything we listen to.
Complicated copyright issues make things worse. If my favorite song cannot be found on a website, 
I'll probably just not listen to them for years.

**Free of charge**: You can download from YouTube, NetEase, Migu and KuGou for free. No need to 
register for monthly paid memberships.

As a contributor of [GOMU](https://github.com/issadarkthing/gomu), I met serious problems during 
development. The main problem is data race condition. So I rewrote the player in rust, and hope to
solve the problem.

## Supported Formats

Below are the audio formats supported by the various backends.

In the case that metadata is not supported, an attempt will still be made to play the file.

|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Symphonia | You will need [ALSA](https://alsa-project.org) installed to support decoding with symphonia.<br />Note that the ALSA development files are required. These are provided as part of the `libasound2-dev` package on Debian and Ubuntu distributions and `alsa-lib-devel` on Fedora.<br/>In addition `soundtouch` and `clang`(build only) are required. |
| GStreamer | [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

#### Protobuf

This is required to build and run termusic. For ubuntu: `apt-get protobuf-compiler`, For arch: `paru -S protobuf`.

#### Dbus

As right now use_dbus is a configuration option, it's required to compile. For ubuntu: `apt-get libdbus-1-dev`, For arch: `paru -S dbus`.

#### Yt-dlp support

You can optionally install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/) and [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) to download MP3s from Youtube.

#### Album cover support

For kitty, album cover support is default. For other terminals, need ueberzug/ueberzugpp installed and `cover` feature flag compiled.

### Packages

Do note that these will be compiled with the **symphonia** backend.

#### Arch Linux

Arch Linux users can install `termusic` from the [official repositories](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/termusic) using [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/pacman).

```bash
pacman -S termusic
```

#### NetBSD

NetBSD users can install `termusic` from the official repositories.

```bash
pkgin install termusic
```
#### Nix/NixOS

Either in the user's environment:

```bash
nix-env --install termusic
```

Or declaratively in `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
    environment.systemPackagess = with pkgs; [
      ...
      termusic
    ];
}
```

#### Cargo

```bash
cargo install termusic termusic-server --locked
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tramhao/termusic.git
cd termusic
make
```

Then install with:

```bash
make install
```

By default, termusic can display album covers in Kitty or iTerm2 (mac, not tested).
If you need album covers displayed on other terminals, please install [ueberzug](https://github.com/ueber-devel/ueberzug) or [ueberzugpp](https://github.com/jstkdng/ueberzugpp), then:

```bash
make full
```

Finally, you can run it with:

```bash
~/.local/share/cargo/bin/termusic
```

You can copy it anywhere in your `$PATH`. The configuration file for the TUI is located in `~/.config/termusic/tui.toml`, and the configuration file for the server is located in `~/.config/termusic/server.toml` (or on macOS, `~/Library/Application Support/termusic/tui.toml`, `~/Library/Application Support/termusic/server.toml`, respectively). <!---The MacOS, i assume it has the same rules as linux, so its a good idea to check, as i lack and macOS machine.-->
However, as this is a minimalistic program, you don't need to edit the configuration file and almost everything can be set from the app.

## Usage
To play a song, just added it to playlist by `l` key(means load, also the vim key for right direction). 
To switch layout, use number keys. `1` and `2` are the layout for playing music, with a difference that the left panel is local file or database. `3` is the layout for podcasts.
For more operations, please press `ctrl+h` for help. By the way, all key bindings can be changed from config editor, which is brought up by `shift+C`. 

## TODO
- [ ] Allow termusic to apply tui theme colors externally (pywal support). 
- [ ] Better support for album photo. 
- [ ] Better interface to adjust timestamp of lyric.
- [ ] Rating and sync support.
- [x] Multiple root and easy switch.
- [x] Save playlists.
- [x] Listen to rss feeds/Podcasts. Need a new layout.
